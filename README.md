MagicSquare
===========

The is a Java program (Swing GUI and applet) that searches for
[magic squares](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square). You can [read more
about it](http://minimul.ro/patrat-magic) on my page (in Romanian). Sorry about
the bad code, I wrote it a while ago.

Run it
------

Here is a
[built JAR file](http://minimul.ro/static/patrat-magic/MagicSquare.jar), or
you can [run the applet](http://minimul.ro/patrat-magic) on my page.

This is how it looks while searching.
